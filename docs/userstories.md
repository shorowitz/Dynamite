* As a user, I want to be able to start the game.
* As a user, I want to see a complete tower at the start of the game.
* As a user, I want the game to decide which player goes first at random, determining who is player 1 and who is player 2, based on their seat in front of the computer (i.e. "the person on the left is going first!").
* As a user, if I am informed it is my turn, I want to be able to select a block and see it disappear from the tower.
* As a user, I want the game to tell me whose turn it is after each turn.
* As a user, if one of the two players clicks the hidden dynamite block, I want to see all the remaining blocks fall or disappear.
* As a user, I want to know which player lost (the player who clicked the dynamite), and which player won.
* As a user, I want to be able to reset the game at the end.
